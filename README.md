Star Phaser is my first programming project. It was designed to combat the burden of boredom.

No installations needed to play Star Phaser. Simply visit https://q1-project-a50b7.firebaseapp.com/ to play.

The API that I used will allow the player to post their name and score to the site. Here is a link to the docs https://galvanize-leader-board.herokuapp.com/.
